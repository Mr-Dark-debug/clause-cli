## Usage Instructions for AI Assistants

1. **When stuck**: Write your question in "Open Questions" and continue with other work
2. **When deciding**: Document the decision in "Decision Log" with rationale
3. **When blocked**: Add to "Blockers" and check back periodically
4. **When reasoning**: Use "Reasoning Space" to think through complex problems
5. **Keep it clean**: Remove resolved items, keep only active context

**Remember**: This file is your second brain. Use it to maintain context across long sessions and to avoid asking the user for every small decision.
